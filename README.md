This repo contains the files that will be used in one of Paris Naik-Neenan's art exhibitions.

This particular part of the exhibition is a raspberry pi with a button connected that, when the button is pressed, will print out one of two images to its connected printer, and this is what the python file in this repo manages. This installment in the exhibition is for highlighting the frequency of s**ual assault by using the real percentages to inform the viewer whether their child will, or won't experience a*sault in their lifetime.
