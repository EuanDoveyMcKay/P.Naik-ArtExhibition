This repo contains the files that will be used in one of Paris Naik-Neenan's art exhibitions.
Some of the files may be in relation to sensitive topics, such as S**ual A**ault (and the chances of it happening),
so if any of these themes discomfort and/or upset you, then have caution when browsing the repo.

**Note**
These topics are not covered in extreme depth, but ideas about them are covered; everything here is still perfectly SFW.
